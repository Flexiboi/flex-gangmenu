</br>

# WHAT IS IT?
</br>
A custom made gang menu for the qb framework!
</br>
</br>
Setup each safe location for each gang in the config.
</br>
Each gang member can acces the safe to diposit and see who is in the gang.
</br>
The gangleader can kick, promote, demote and upgrade.
</br>
Each safe is protected by a minigame that gets triggerd when people try to steal money (amount set in config and times the level of security) set in config.
</br>
I have made all colors ez changeable in css.
</br>
</br>
<strong>Upgrades include:</strong>
</br>
- Better security
</br>
- More storage
</br>
(You can define each stuff like cost or add more in the config.)
</br>
</br>

# How to edit the minigames
</br>
You can edit or make your own minigames that are triggerd when someone tries to steal money.
</br>
Edit the minigames in <strong>minigames.lua</strong>
</br>
On fail it sends a notify to all the gang members.
